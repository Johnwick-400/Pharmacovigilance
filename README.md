## Pharmacovigilance:

## Overview
This project aims to build a system that suggests suitable drugs based on a patient's medical condition while also providing detailed information about the effects and potential side effects of the recommended drugs. The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patient data and drug information.

## Objectives
- Recommend appropriate drugs based on patient conditions and symptoms.
- Analyze and provide insights into the effects and potential side effects of recommended drugs.
- Improve patient care and medication decision-making through data-driven recommendations.

## Model Information
- **Model Name:** LLaMA2-Chat-7B
- **Model Type:** Language Model
- **Model Purpose:** Analyzing patient data, drug information, and providing drug recommendations along with side effect analysis.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Contains datasets related to patient conditions, drug information, and side effects.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and recommendation system development.
- **src/**: Source code for the drug recommendation system, NLP model integration, and data processing scripts.
- **results/**: Results, logs, and evaluation metrics generated during system development and testing.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project, system functionalities, and repository structure.
